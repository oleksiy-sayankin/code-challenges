Binary search tree
==================

A binary search tree is a special kind of binary tree in which, for each node, the following properties must be satisfied:

* The value of all the nodes in the left subtree should be less than that of the parent node.
* The value of all the nodes in the right subtree should be greater than that of the parent node.
* The left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

The tree below is an example of a valid binary search tree:

                10
               /  \
              5    15
            /  \  /  \
           3   7  12  20

Check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.
