You are given an expression of the form a+b , where a and b are integers from 0 to 9 . You have to evaluate it and print the result.

Input
-----

The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing an expression of the form a+b (0≤a,b≤9, both a and b are integers). The integers are not separated from the + sign.

Output
------
For each test case, print one integer — the result of the expression.
