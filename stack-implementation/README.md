======================

Challenge Description:
----------------------

![Challenge Image](stack_implementation.png)

Write a program which implements a stack interface for integers. The interface should have ‘push’ and ‘pop’ functions. Your task is to ‘push’ a series of integers and then ‘pop’ and print every alternate integer.

Input sample:
------------

Your program should accept a file as its first argument. The file contains a series of space delimited integers, one per line.

For example:

    1 2 3 4
    10 -2 3 4
    
Output sample:
------------

Print to stdout every alternate space delimited integer, one per line.

For example:
    
    4 2
    4 -2
